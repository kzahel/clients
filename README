requirements: (clone them into this directory)

git://github.com/pwmckenna/btapp
git://github.com/kzahel/falcon-api

usage:
create conduit toolbar with two html components:
(client.html on the left)
(torrent.html on the right)

NOTE: "falcon-api" may need to be configured to use  {{ srp_root: 'http://remote-staging.utorrent.com' }}
(this is currently the default server setting in this repository)




NOTE about conduit architecture: All 3 browsers have very different behavior.
========
IE: each tab gets its own toolbar. Navigating to new pages does not
force the toolbar to re-initialize.

Chrome: each tab gets its own toolbar. Navigating to a new page forces
a complete toolbar re-initialization.

Firefox: The toolbar is shared across tabs, so each browser window
gets its own toolbar.

Currently the design of the toolbar is pretty bad. It was really only
written with one tab in mind. Each tab is independently synchronizing
with the remote client, causing unnecessarry network load. Thus TODO:
make only one tab the "active" tab, and have all other tabs receive
updates via EBGlobalKeyChanged.
