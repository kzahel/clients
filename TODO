IE toolbar bug -- StoreGlobalKey cannot be called in consecutively, there must be some amount of delay. Implement a queue for messages.
Also each document needs to use its own global key so that it doesn't interfere with other SetGlobalKey. But then we'll be leaking keys... hrm

major: allow switch client without refreshing whole toolbar
major: only one gadget window communicates with ut updates other gadgets with SetGlobalKey
