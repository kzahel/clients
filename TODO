after pairing "torrent" shows "Loading"
deny pairing should allow login to remote
removing the last client from the list causes n+1 reloads where n is number of tabs (other messages cause this problem too?)
"Loading" on the torrent app (initialize states)

IE toolbar bug -- StoreGlobalKey cannot be called in consecutively, there must be some amount of delay. Implement a queue for messages

----

major: allow switch client without refreshing whole toolbar
major: only one gadget window communicates with ut updates other gadgets with SetGlobalKey
